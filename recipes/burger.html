    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a hamburger with a slice of melted cheese on top of the meat patty, added near the end of the
        cooking time. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure, ingredients and composition. As with other
        hamburgers, a cheeseburger may include various condiments and other toppings such as lettuce, tomato, onion,
        pickles, bacon, avocado, mushrooms, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard.</p>
    <p>In US fast food restaurants, processed cheese is usually used, although other meltable cheeses are used, such as
        cheddar, Swiss, mozzarella, blue cheese, or pepper jack. Restaurant chains that sell cheeseburgers include
        McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.</p>
