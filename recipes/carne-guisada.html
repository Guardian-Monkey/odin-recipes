    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carne guisada literally just means “stewed beef.” What&apos;s so special about stewed beef?</p>
    <p>First, carne guisada, cooked low and slow, magically turns a cheap cut of beef into super tender, fall apart
        meat. Its connective tissues are actually an asset, because the low slow heat breaks them down and makes the
        meat so soft and delectable.</p>
    <p>Second, carne guisada is deceptively simple. You might already have ALL the other ingredients at your house!
        Tomato sauce, onion, cumin, beef bouillon, garlic powder, and a little salt and pepper–we&apos;re not talking
        fancy
        or expensive ingredients. This short list is all you need.</p>
